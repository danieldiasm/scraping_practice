## Webscraper Experiments
###### A few scripts of web scraping examples of mine

### Description
A good source of tutorials can be found on the *sources* section of this page, Real Python has a lot
of interesting stuff that worth checking out.

You'll find only one tutorial on this repo for now, later on I will separate by directories and
put on "requirements" file to each.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this is to serve as a reference for myself, it might become useful to others,
that is why I did it public and added sources from where I've collected info and did tutorials.

### Motivation
I wanted to do some webscraping because:
1. I just wanted to have fun programing.
2. Webscraping is interesting.
3. Can be a useful skill to have.
4. I have some fun little projects in mind.
